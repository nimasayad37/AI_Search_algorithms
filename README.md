# AI_Search_algorithms 🧩

![Maze Screenshot](assets/screenshot.png) <!-- Optional -->

## 📝 Description
This project implements classic AI search algorithms to solve mazes.  
It was developed as a course project for **Artificial Intelligence** at AmirKabir University of Technology.  

The project includes:  
- Maze generation (`maze_generator.py`) with only one best route.  
- Multiple search algorithms (`algorithms.py`): DFS, BFS, A*, Greedy, IDS.  
- Visualization of the algorithm solving the maze (`graphics.py`).  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Generate random mazes of any size.  
- Solve the maze using 5 AI search algorithms.  
- Visualize the solution path using a graphical interface.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.x  
- Libraries: `pygame`, `numpy`
